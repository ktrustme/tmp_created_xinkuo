Feedback from Pan Li:
1. Add a background image in the user profile, like what facebook does in the user home page.
2. The login and signup page could be more interesting.
3. I like the color :) 

Feedback from Ning Wang:
1. The global post page looks empty. 
2. You may add a "Forget password?" function on the login page.
3. Comment and "like" function on the home page?
