To turn in homework 1, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

======================================================================

the calculator homework is contained in the ./calculator subdir:
calculator.html
./css/calculator.css

the grumblr homework is contained in the ./grumblesubdir:
global_post.html
profile.html
login.html
signup.html
./css/global_post.css

For some feedback on wireframe design, I directly make some change on the html and css.
For other feedbacks, I would add more features later, maybe using js. 

And I'm considering redo the css by using less. Writing raw css is too... painful...
