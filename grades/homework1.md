Homework 1 Feedback
==================

Commit graded: 68a43361b75069ab3c723a31ba897daea8cd3b8c

### Grumblr design process (15/20)
 * -0, You should not only document the changes that would result because of the feedback, but also why the person gave that feedback as well. The feedback should be focused on design, rather than completeness (as in, you should not have asked a peer what you are 'missing', rather you should ask their opinion on how easy to use and how good it looks).
 * -5, Evidence of design iteration is missing from your submission. After receiving feedback, you should have revised your design and submitted the edited wireframes alongside the originals.

### Demonstrates basic familiarity with HTML and CSS

#### Completeness: Solution meets basic specification (14/15)
 * -1, Links that lead to a page represented by your static design should actually take the user to the static page. For example, the link to the Sign-up should correctly link to your static design of the register page.
 * -0, Consider adding a link to the logged-in user's profile page from the follower stream.

#### Demonstrates understanding of HTML/CSS (24/25)
 * -1, We recommend avoiding in-line styling (e.g. `style="..."` in tags) when possible. Using CSS rules instead will make it easier to find and apply styling changes to your pages.

### Appropriate use of course infrastructure and Git (10/10)
 * -0, Only files necessary for your homework solution only should be committed.  Files like .DS_Store are not necessary.  Ideally you should commit only source files, not derived files, to your version control repository.  If you find yourself accidentally committing derived files to your repository you should probably add the appropriate file types to your .gitignore file (https://github.com/CMU-Web-Application-Development/xkuo/blob/master/.gitignore).  See [https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/] for details.
